This is a digital reincarnation of the simon memory game. 
The rules remain the same: Press letter 'A' on your keyboard, then try to recreate the blinking patterns of the various colored buttons in their respective order. If you mess this pattern up, you lose. Else, your score will continously increase in terms of levels. 
Have fun!
